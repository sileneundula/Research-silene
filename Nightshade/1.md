# Project Nightshade: Advancements To The Onion Router (TOR) Network Through Use of Ring Signatures, Verifiable Random Functions, and other Cryptographic Primitives.

## Methodology 1: The Onion Router Node Conformity Through Ring Signatures and Verifiable Random Functions

### Introduction

**The Onion Router (TOR)** serves as an online network that encrypts traffic and anonymizes the traffic through the use of:

1. Gateway Nodes
2. Relay Nodes
3. Exit Nodes

It works by encrypting traffic through each relay, starting from the client to the gateway, which is encrypted to the next, and the next, until it finally reaches its destination. The basic assumption is that because there are so many Hidden Services, it would be difficult to determine which address is being sent to except for the exit relay.
